// sum all of the numbers that are adjacent to symbols
// parse an int
// check if it is adjacent to a symbol
// if yes, add it to the sum
// if no continue

// when parsing, how can we tell when something is adjacent?
// we could remember the coordinates of where a number was?
// how do we avoid counting numbers twice?

// when we add a number, we could overwrite that number with 0 so that we do not count it again?

// or, we could simply forget about that number...
